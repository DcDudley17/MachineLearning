Homework 7 - Clustering taxi locations 
  Based on the given latitude and longitude of taxi pickup and dropoff locations, we are able to apply kmeans and clustering to display a map of the main locations where the pickups and dropoffs are located. This would be useful when trying to decide locations to place taxi distribution centers, and main locations of which people need to be picked up or dropped off by a taxi.

Homework 8 - Regression with neural networks
  Using a neural net, we are able to accuratly follow the curve of any function with enough epochs. The Jupyter notebook attached shows the function creation as well as the curves being fit by our neural network.
