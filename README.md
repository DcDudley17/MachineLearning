Homework 8 - Regression with neural networks
  Using a neural net, we are able to accuratly follow the curve of any function with enough epochs. The Jupyter notebook attached shows the function creation as well as the curves being fit by our neural network.

  
Homework 7 - Clustering taxi locations 
  Based on the given latitude and longitude of taxi pickup and dropoff locations, we are able to apply kmeans and clustering to display a map of the main locations where the pickups and dropoffs are located. This would be useful when trying to decide locations to place taxi distribution centers, and main locations of which people need to be picked up or dropped off by a taxi.

Homework 6 - 
We are trying to determine what features are most important when classifying what type of credit the given individual has, and then use a random forrest classifier to try and classify the test data based on those parameters. 

Below is the importance of each feature ranked using the dataframe function.

After we ran this with our data, below is the confusion matrix of our classification on the test data.

Homework 5 - 
We are attempting to determine the weather type based on a given dataset that has weather information using SVR and RBF. 

Below is the confusion matrix based on our calculations
